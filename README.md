Huffman Encoding and Compression Project
1. Course Information
Course name: Data Structures
Student: Ahmed Salah Ibrahim
University: October University for Modern Sciences & Arts (MSA)
Instructor: Doctor Ahmed Farouk
2. Project Overview
This project implements a complete Huffman encoding and decoding system in C++. Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm that reduces the size of text data by encoding characters with variable-length binary strings based on their frequency. The main features of this project include the following:

3. Features and Functionality
3.1 Frequency Calculation
The program calculates the frequency of each character in a given input text or file.
3.2 Huffman Tree Construction
A linked list is used to construct the Huffman tree, with nodes sorted by frequency.
3.3 Code Generation
The program generates Huffman codes for each character based on the tree structure.
3.4 Compression
The input data is compressed by converting characters into their corresponding Huffman codes and storing the binary representation in a compressed file.
3.5 Decompression
The compressed file is decoded back into the original text using the Huffman codes and the tree.
3.6 File I/O Support
The program can process input from a text file or manually entered text and outputs the compressed and decompressed data to files.
4. How the Program Works
4.1 User Input
The user is prompted to choose whether to provide text directly or read it from a file.
The program reads the input text and calculates the frequency of each character.
4.2 Building the Huffman Tree
A sorted linked list is used to manage the nodes during the construction of the Huffman tree.
Nodes are combined iteratively based on their frequencies until a single root node is formed.
4.3 Encoding and Compression
Huffman codes are generated for each character in the input text.
The entire input text is converted into a binary string using these codes.
The binary string is then compressed into a binary file for storage.
4.4 Decompression
The compressed file is read, and its binary data is decoded back into the original text using the Huffman tree.
The decoded text is saved into an output file.
5. Input and Output
5.1 Input Options
The user can input:
Text entered manually.
A file containing the text to be compressed.
5.2 Output Files
The following files are generated by the program:
compress_file.txt: Contains the compressed binary data.
all_input_code.txt: Stores the Huffman-encoded binary string.
outputfile_<input_filename>: The decompressed text file.
6. Features and Benefits
Efficient Memory Management: The program uses dynamic data structures to manage memory effectively.
Flexible Input: Supports both manually entered text and file input for compression.
Reliable File Operations: Handles file reading, writing, and compression/decompression seamlessly.
Lossless Compression: The program ensures that no data is lost during the compression or decompression processes.
